# RCV and minority representation

This Python code base accompanies the paper [Ranked Choice Voting and Minority Representation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3778021) by Benade, Buck, Gold, Duchin and Weighill. The STV simulations for each case study are available as standalone `.py` files and print their output in a format suitable for inclusion into `template_table.tex`. To run the simulations for a different jurisdiction or hypothetical scenario, simply duplicate one of these files and adjust the parameters at the top.

The repo also contains the Census and election data used in the case studies (Terrebonne Parish LA, Cincinnati OH, Jones County NC and Pasadena TX) in the paper.
